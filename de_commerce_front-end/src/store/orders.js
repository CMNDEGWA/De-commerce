/**
 * Orders Store Module (Pinia)
 *
 * This module manages the user's orders using Pinia stores.
 * Stores frontend-side order state persisted to localStorage.
 * 
 * Note: This appears to be a frontend-only implementation.
 * Backend has order management via /api/orders/ endpoints.
 * Frontend may use this local store as cache/mirror of backend orders.
 * 
 * When checkout occurs:
 * 1. Order created in backend via API
 * 2. Frontend may add order to local store
 * 3. User can view orders from local store or fresh from backend

     * - Empty array if nothing in localStorage

     * - Saves as JSON string in localStorage key 'orders'

     * Accessed by:
     * - Profile.vue: Displays user's orders under profile
     * - OrderHistory.vue: Could show list of orders (currently unused)
     * - OrderDetail.vue: Could show order details (currently unused)
     * 
     * Note on Implementation:
     * Frontend locally tracks orders with timestamp IDs.
     * Backend /api/orders/ API provides authoritative order data.
     * This store may be redundant with backend API orders.

     * addOrder(): Create new order and add to orders list
     * 
     * @param {Object} product - Product being ordered {id, name, price, ...}
     * @param {string} [status='pending'] - Initial order status (default 'pending')
     * 
     * Logic:
     * 1. Creates order object with:
     *    - id: Current timestamp (Date.now())
     *    - product: Passed product object
     *    - status: Passed status or 'pending'
     *    - created_at: Current ISO timestamp
     * 2. Pushes order to this.orders array
     * 3. Calls save() to persist to localStorage
     * 
     * Called by:
     * - ProductDetail.vue toggleCart(): When product added to cart
     *   But implementation appears to add to orders instead of cart
     * - Checkout flow: After order placed successfully
     * - Could be called when order confirmed
     * 
     * ID Generation:
     * - Uses Date.now() for unique timestamp-based IDs
     * - Provides millisecond precision
     * - Not database-style sequential IDs
     * 
     * Example:
     * const product = {id: 3, name: "Laptop", price: 999.99};
     * orders.addOrder(product, 'pending');
     * // Order created with id = 1705334400000 (Date.now())
     * // Order added to orders array
     * // Persisted to localStorage

     * @param {number} orderId - ID of order to update
     * @param {string} status - New status ('pending', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled')
     * 
     * Logic:
     * 1. Finds order by orderId
     * 2. If found, updates order.status to new status
     * 3. Calls save() to persist change
     * 4. Does nothing if orderId not found (silent failure)
     * 
     * Called by:
     * - Admin/management interface (not implemented in current app)
     * - Simulating status changes (for testing)
     * - Could be called when webhook indicates order shipped
     * 
     * Status Progression (typical flow):
     * 1. addOrder() creates with status='pending'
     * 2. updateStatus(orderId, 'shipped') when order ships
     * 3. updateStatus(orderId, 'delivered') when delivered
     * 
     * Example:
     * orders.updateStatus(1705334400000, 'shipped');
     * // Order status changed from 'pending' to 'shipped'
     * // Persisted to localStorage
